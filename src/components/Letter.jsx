        Dear Bush, <br />
        From the moment you came into my life, everything felt warmer and brighter.
        The days and weeks are flying by, and I can't believe we're almost at our three
        month anniversary! I missed you so so much over this winter break, and I can't
        wait any longer to ask you this. You're so incredibly patient and kind with me,
        even when I'm being a bongo barbarian. Sometimes I wonder what I did to deserve
        someone as amazing as you. There's really no way I can express how much you mean
        to me over words. I wish you could be in my body, so you can see yourself through
        my eyes and heart. You are the most beautiful and perfect person I've ever known.
        Thank you for making me the happiest and most loved I've ever been. I can't believe
        how I'm writing corny letters now, when I used to cringe at them. But for you, I'd
        write a thousand more. Hopefully, by the end of my life, I get to that number. I'm
        sorry for all the times I pmo you or make you want to beat me up😀, but that's part
        of my charm, right?😁😁 Okay okay, this letter is getting pretty long. Enough cuteness👹👹👹.
        You make me laugh, you inspire me, and you feel like home. I’m so grateful
        for you and I’d love to spend Valentine’s Day together.
